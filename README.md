# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction
Chronic kidney disease is a significant condition due to its prevalence. 
There are many individuals who suffer from kidney disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition where the kidneys gradually lose their function, filtering waste and excess water out of the body. 
If it is kidney disease, the ability to filter waste decreases, resulting in the accumulation of waste in the blood and causing high blood pressure, anemia, and an increased risk of heart and vascular diseases. 
Kidney disease is considered dangerous if it is not treated promptly and properly. Medical professionals and good equipment can help identify patients at risk of kidney disease and provide necessary assistance.
